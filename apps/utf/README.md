## Development

### Local project start

Copy `.env.development.example`, rename the new file to `.env.dev.local`.

```bash
npm i

npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Update locales and api schema

`npm run update-api` - to update the api schema
`npm run update-locales` - to update locales

Carefully review before committing!

## Versioning

To release a new version, run:
```bash
# To release a prototype on current version tag
npm run prerelease
# or
npm run pre-patch
npm run pre-minor
npm run pre-major
# depending on which version should be upped on the next stable release

# To make a stable release
npm run patch
npm run minor
npm run major
# depending on which version should be considered stable
```

## Building and running

By default, `npm run build` will generate a Node app that you can run with `npm start`. To use a different adapter, add it to the `devDependencies` in `package.json` and specify in your `vite.config.js`.

The final build will be put into the `dist` folder, from where it can be served in two ways:
- as an spa, from the `dist/public` folder
- as a full server app, by running the `dist/server.js` script via node.js
  - In this mode, a port can be set via the `PORT` env variable (default is `3000`)

## Deploy/CI

There are 4 main environment types
- ðŸ”´ [Dev](): same as Sandbox, but mostly used for local testing on backend.

- ðŸŸ¡ [Sandbox](): simply push to the [`dev` branch](/tree/dev).\
  Uses vercel.com to deploy the app to a quick telegram-native playground with sourcemaps, fastest builds.

- ðŸŸ¢ [Test](): create a Pull Request from `dev` to `main` with a corresponding [label](#labels).\
  Uses GitHub Actions to build and deploy the app into an environment that most closely resembles production.

- ðŸ”µ [Production](https://t.me/UTasksBot): merge said Pull Request.\
  âš  **Final production environment**

### Under the hood

Deployment works via github actions workflow. There are 2 main actions:
- ðŸŸ¢ `pr-test` - happens when a Pull Request was opened from `dev` to `main`\
  Calls:
  - `version-test`: creates and publishes a pre-release tag based on the PR's [label](#labels);
  - `build-dev`: builds the app in a pre-production environment using the `.env.dev` environment settings file and pushes the resulting build to **packages**;
  - `deploy-test`: deploys the built package to the test environment
- ðŸ”µ `pr-prod` - happens when the said Pull Request is merged into main\
  Calls:
  - `version-prod`: creates and publishes a production release tag based on the PR's [label](#labels);
  - `build-dev`: builds the app in a full production environment using the `.env.production` environment settings file and pushes the resulting build to packages;
  - `deploy-production`: deploys the built package to [production](https://t.me/UTasksBot)

### Labels

When making a PR from `dev` to `main`, it's imperative to set the release label in order to properly tag the app version.

There are 3 main labels used when tagging the app version:
- `release/patch`
- `release/minor`
- `release/major`

These labels are then read using [`action-release-label`](https://github.com/actions-ecosystem/action-release-label) and used to determine which `npm version` script to run.

### Under the hood

> NOTE\
> There are optional dependencies declared in `package.json`,\
> they are only needed for local development and have no effect on the production build.

#### Build

```bash
# omit optional dependencies, shaves off ~30% from npm install time
npm ci --omit=optional
npm run build
```

#### ENV

App will assume by-default that it is served under the `/utf/` subpath, on port 443 (see `.env.production` file).\
When deploying from the PR, the app will use the `.env.dev` file instead.

The `npm run build` command expects several ENV variables to be provided to the process:
- `APP_HOST` - the main host of the app, `localhost` if not provided;
- `APP_PORT` - the port that the app expects to be served under, `443` if not provided;
- `APP_BASE` - the subpath that the app expects to be served under, '/utf/' if not provded, must start and end with `/`.
- `APP_DEV` - whether the build should contain development-specific code
- `APP_PROD` - whether the build should contain production-specific code
- `APP_BACKEND` - default backend url, in case fetching the remote config fails
- `APP_FIREBASE_CONFIG` - firebase app config, the app needs it to authorize requests to firebase remoteconfig and realtime database (l10n solution)
- `APP_CONFIG_BACKENDURL` - the backend url key in config

Failure to provide any of these variables may result in a failed build.
