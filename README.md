### Deploy

- ðŸ”´ [Dev](): same as Sandbox, but mostly used for local testing on backend.
- ðŸŸ¡ [Sandbox](): simply push to the [`dev` branch](/tree/dev).

- ðŸ”µ [Production](https://t.me/UTasksBot): merge said Pull Request.

### Local project start

Copy `.env.local.example`, rename the new file to `.env.dev.local`.

```bash
npm i -ws

npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Update locales and api schema

`npm run update-api -w utf` - to update the api schema
`npm run update-locales -w utf` - to update locales

Carefully review before committing!

## Why ?

This monorepo is a part of a long-term transitioning plan to separate all internal packages and projects into separate repositories.\
Since the project is still in early development stages, full decoupling would prove difficult and cumbersome - proper concern boundaries are not set yet, and the code that is split into separate repositories could quickly become tightly-coupled.\
Keeping the packages in a single repo allows initial tight coupling, while maintaing mental barriers between different concerns in the code.
